          <p class="p1">
            Numerous self-improvement applications focus on aspects like goal
            setting and meditation, but they often lack a sense of community
            that can offer solace to individuals who may experience feelings of
            loneliness during their journey of personal growth.
          </p>
          <h2 class="htwo">Solution:</h2>
          <p class="p1">
            Develop a platform dedicated to self-improvement, providing a
            vibrant hub where individuals on their personal growth journey can
            connect with one another in real-time. This platform would enable
            them to share their experiences, exchange valuable tips and tricks,
            and ultimately feel a stronger sense of community, alleviating the
            sense of loneliness often associated with self-improvement
            endeavors.

            I conducted competitor analysis for this project. As we all know,
            researching and identifying key features and issues from other apps
            is a great way to understand what is needed to create a great app. I
            did research on two similar self-improvement apps, Headspace and
            Clarity. I was able to identify what users were looking for in an
            app whether its UI changes or new features.

            With the help of some App Store reviews, user concerns made known.
            This gave me insightful information about each app, whether it be
            about the lack of UI or features. However there are some problems
            with this. Firstly, it is important to note that these reviews do
            not account for unique and holistic individual experiences, and thus
            can not give us insights with real depth. Regardless, this allowed
            us to develop a baseline understanding of pain points and gave us
            required information to begin developing our ideas of the app's
            structure and Information Architecture.

              I chose to maintain a clean and simple UI in my self-improvement
              app to prevent users from feeling overwhelmed. This was done using
              a analogous color scheme. The Blue helps to represent trust within
              the app, a key user painpoint that was sought out to solve, and
              the green helps represent growth, peace, and calm, crucial in a
              self-improvement app. I also ensured that there was consistency in
              the color scheme and design elements throughout the app to provide
              a cohesive and seamless user experience. My goal for this app was
              to create a space where it gave off a friendly and approachable
              feel. With this goal in mind, pastels of greens and blues and
              accents of warm colours satisfied those needs. Also, to avoid the
              cluster of different colours, elements, and features, I opted for
              a very clean UI and a smaller and more controlled palette than
              usual. The font I chose for this app was Inter. I wanted to make
              GrowthHub as user friendly as possible, and by doing so, I kept a
              couple things in mind while choosing the font. First, I wanted to
              have a font that was easy to read, no matter how big or small the
              screen is. Secondly, Inter gives off a friendly, yet professional
              vibe. GrowthHub aims to welcome new users to the app and by using
              Inter, it was one step forward to achieving my goal.
